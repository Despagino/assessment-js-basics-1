// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/





// Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const requirementOfAnalysis = "The second step. Here is where we lay out the requirements of the application. What it needs for it to be successful, to be functional, to be useable are some things to consider in this phase. Requirements also means defininf what resources are needed to build the project. "

const design = "The third step. The design phase models the way a software application will work."

const implementation = "The fourth step, where we actually start writing our program. These tasks include creating user guides, troubleshooting what is wrong, fixing and refactoring code and all things to build an application."

const testing = "The fifth step. Testing should ensure that each function works correctly. Different parts of the application should also be tested to work seamlessly together—performance test, to reduce any hangs or lags in processing."

const deployment = "The second to last step, the deployment (product version). This is where the application is made available to users."

const maintain = "The last step. At this point, the development cycle is almost finished. The application is done and being used in the field. The Operation and Maintenance phase is still important, though. In this phase, users discover bugs that weren’t found during testing."
